# fuzzylitex

Extensions to the [fuzzylite](http://www.fuzzylite.com) project that will be hopefully integrated into the official *fuzzylite* project.


## ANN Extension

This extension provides basic functionalities for *Artificial Neural Networks* (ANN).


## ANFIS Extension

This extension provides both the *Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System* (ANFIS) and the related *Coactive ANFIS (CANFIS)* model to support multiple outputs.
For a discussion of such models see [1].
